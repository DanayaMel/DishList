Notes

# Project

- At first I had a simple users table but due to how little information was displayed and each meal having a picture,
  I thought it'd be nicer to show the meal.
- I always like backend/frontend project file structure because you can find where everything is quickly.
- Usually, I would leave better comments and logs for the code.

# Frontend

- Clean design, used antd library once I was tasked with using a Typescript frontend.
- Used a simple API for frontend for connecting to meal database and simple API for the backend for user data.
- Favorite food should remain a link but would be better if there were less styling added to it to make it more consistent.

# Backend

- Wanted a concise file structure and project. Broke down files by purpose (i.e service, types, components)
- I originally didn't save the meal ID but using the meal's name caused issues and was inconsistent.

# Wants & Wishes

- Wanted drawer for recipe in it's own component.
- Wanted to have a separate header bar in it's own component.
